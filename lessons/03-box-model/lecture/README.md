# 3. Box Model

- Box Model
- Collapsing Margin
- Width and Height issues
- Box-sizing
- Negative Margins
- Inline-Block
- Centering Block, Inline, and Inline Block
- Inline-Block Tiles

Build a "panel" website like http://redstonecapitalmanagement.com/

Where I left off:

- Better strategy for selectors (add card group so cards can be their own thing)
- talk about negative margins (like redstone)
- Don't use height too often, let it be derived
